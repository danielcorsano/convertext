# ConverText Configuration File Example
#
# Place this file in any directory to configure conversions for files in that
# directory and its subdirectories. The config is automatically discovered when
# converting files - it searches from the file's location up through parent
# directories.
#
# Priority: CLI args > local convertext.yaml > ~/.convertext/config.yaml > defaults
#
# To use: Copy this file to your working directory and rename to convertext.yaml

# Output settings
output:
  directory: null                   # Output directory (null = same as source)
  filename_pattern: "{name}.{ext}"  # Output naming pattern
  overwrite: false                  # Overwrite existing files

# Document format settings
documents:
  encoding: utf-8                   # Text file encoding
